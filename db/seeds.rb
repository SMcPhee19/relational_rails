# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# colorado_avalanche = Team.create!(city: "Denver",
#   team_name: "Avalanche",
#   stanley_cup_champ: true,
#   points: 119,
#   division: "Central" )

# seattle_kraken = Team.create!(city: "Seattle",
#   team_name: "Kraken",
#   stanley_cup_champ: false,
#   points: 60,
#   division: "Pacific" )
